					Mbappe
			</h1></p>
			<hr>
			<p> After bursting onto the world news nearly three years ago now, <br>
				Mbappe has rocked the footballing world with his amazing blend of <br>
				pace and skill. He is seen as one of the main factors for Monaco's <br>
				success in winning the Ligue 1 and upsetting the league favourites <br>
				Paris-Saint Germain. Many former players haven't been shy to heap <br>
				praise onto the boy. The young 20 year old has been labeled as the <br>
				newest football potential breakthrough of the dominanent pairing of the <br>
				worlds best and potentially the best of all time, Lionel Messi and <br>
				Cristiano Ronaldo. </p>
				
			<img src = "../images/Ronaldo.jpg" />
			<p>	Currently Mbappe is showing the world why he is not a one season <br>
				wonder and has been tearing up the Ligue 1 again, this time for the <br>
				team that he toppled PSG. In his combined 12 matches in the Ligue 1 and <br>
				champions league, he has 9 goals, not an easy feat and much better then <br>
				Ronaldo or Messi was at this stage in their careear. Although, the one </p>
				
			<p>	thing that Messi and Ronaldo have over Mbappe is each other. Mbappe <br>
				doesn't really have a opposition driving force to push him to be the <br>
				best like Ronaldo and Messi did for each other. Mbappe also has a few <br>
				downsides to him. Many say that most players can put up these stats as, <br>
				PSG have a stigma for getting very easy group draws and going out once <br>
				they come up against a top team. The ligue 1 has also been known as a <br>
				one team league with PSG's riches and complete dominance. </p>
				
			<p>	Mbappe doesn't seem keen to leave his home country soon though and many <br>
				believe that he will never leave the French capital during his prime <br>
				footballing years. </p>
