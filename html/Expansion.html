				<p>
					The NFL is always looking to expand. The commision belives that the current 32 NFL team is getting stale. <br>
					To counteract this, they plan on expanding the NFL to a 40 league team. The problems are that most cities <br>
					that are big enough already have a NFL team or for some two. The NFL do like to play a few games in London <br>
					every year and some in Mexico City. Could these two cities get enough traction to hold interest for an entire <br>
					season? Would a owner want their team in these cities as chances are the goverments won't play the way that the <br>
					US city goverments do? For all these reasons is it smart to expand the NFL in the first place. </p>
					
				<p>
					Would the talent be able to keep up? The current rosters are looking very thin in talent, the coaching staffs are <br>
					in a constant state of flux. Would many players play more then the current brutal 16 games? Washington star Corner <br>
					Josh Newman has already stated that he wouldn't play a 17th game unless they got rid of the pre-season. Does this <br>
					force players and coaches into situations where they aren't prepared for? How much furter would this give an <br>
					adavantage to well structered and run teams like the Patriots and Saints. How many of these teams would end up <br>
					being like Cleaveland? Being poorly run and having high turn over rates at the coach postions. </p>
