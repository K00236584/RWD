			<p><h1> What information GitHub collects and why </p></h2>
			<p><h2>Categories of personal information </h2></p>
			<p>"User Personal Information" is any personal information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, <br>
			personally identify them. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of <br>
			“User Personal Information.” User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation. </p>
			<p>"Technical Information" may include information we collect from website browsers, such as web server logs, or other log information, <br>
			such as User session or activity logs. Technical Information may be connected to User Personal Information such as a username or an email address, <br>
			or to other potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. </p>
			<p>User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally <br>
			identifying information to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our website and service. </p>

			<p><h2>Information from users with accounts </p></h2>
			<p>If you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your own user name and password,<br>
			and we will ask you for a valid email address. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information." </p>

			<p>If you sell a GitHub Marketplace application or raise funds through the GitHub Sponsors Program, we require some additional information <br>
			through the registration process. We may require identification information and banking information for you to receive funds through those services.</p>

			<p><h2>Information from website browsers</p></h2>
			<p>If you're just browsing the website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, <br>
			such as cookies and web server logs, to collect Technical Information. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not.</p>

			<p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional <br>
			websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. </p>

			<p><h2>Information we collect from third parties</p></h3>
			<p>From time to time, GitHub receives personal information about individuals from third parties. This may happen if you sign <br>
			up for a training or to receive information about GitHub from one of our vendors. </p>

			<p><h2>Why we collect this information</p></h2>
			<p>We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request, including to provide <br>
			the GitHub service, the Marketplace service, the Sponsors Program, or to respond to support requests.<br>
			We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on GitHub.<br>
			We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.<br>
			We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons <br>
			you’ve said that’s okay. Please see our section on email communication for more information. <br>
			We use User Personal Information and other data to make recommendations for you, such as to suggest projects you may want to follow <br>
			or contribute to. For example, when you fill out an interest survey at account creation, we learn from it — as well as from your public <br>
			behavior on GitHub, such as the projects you star — to determine your coding interests, and we recommend similar projects. <br>
			These recommendations are automated decisions, but they have no legal impact on your rights.</p>
			
			<p>We collect Technical Information to better understand how our website visitors use GitHub, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.<br>
			We collect personal information from third parties for the purposes for which it was authorized to be collected. For example, you may authorize <br>
			GitHub to contact you for marketing purposes via a third party's platform. If we need to use your personal information for <br>
			other purposes, we will ask your permission first. </p>
			
			<p>We use your User Personal Information and Technical Information for internal purposes, such as to maintain logs for security reasons,<br>
			for training purposes, and for legal documentation and compliance. We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes <br>
			listed in this Privacy Statement. If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first. <br>
			You can always see what information we have, how we're using it, and what permissions you have given us in your user profile. </p>
			
			<p><h3>Our legal basis for processing information</p></h3>
			<p>Under certain international laws (including GDPR), GitHub is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we <br>
			process User Personal Information. GitHub processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:</p>

			<p><h3>Contract Performance:</p></h3>

			<p>When you create a GitHub account, you provide your user name and an email address. We require those data elements <br>
			for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing <br>
			that contract. We also process your user name and email address on other bases. If you have a GitHub Hosted, GitHub Enterprise Server, <br>
			or other paid account with us, there will be other data elements we must collect and process on the basis of performing that contract. <br>
			GitHub does not collect or process a credit card number, but our third-party payment processor does. When you sell a Marketplace application <br>
			or receive funds through the Sponsors Program, you provide identification and banking information. We process those <br>
			elements on the basis of performing the contract that applies to those services.</p>
			
			<p><h3>Consent:</p></h3>

			<p>As a user, you can fill out the information in your user profile, and you have the option to provide User Personal Information <br>
			such as your full name, an avatar which may include a photograph, your biography, your location, your company, and a URL to a third party website.<br>
			You also have the option of setting a publicly visible email address here. If you decide to participate in a GitHub research project or survey, you may <br>
			choose to provide User Personal Information or other personal information to us for limited purposes. We process this information on the basis of consent.<br>
			All of this information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, <br>
			and delete it at any time (while you are not able to delete your email address entirely, you can make it private). </p>
			
			<p><h3>Legitimate Interests: </p></h3>

			<p>Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests.<br>
			For example, for legal compliance purposes or to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of GitHub's systems, website, and service,<br>
			we must keep logs of Technical Information; and, in order to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices.<br>
			If you would like to request erasure of data we process on the basis of consent or object to our processing of personal information, please use our Privacy contact form. </p>
			
			<p><h3>What information GitHub does not collect</p></h3>
			<p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information,<br>
			or religious information, unless you sell a Marketplace application or raise funds through the Sponsors Program. Although GitHub does not request or <br>
			intentionally collect any other sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a repository<br>
			or in your public profile. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data. </p>

			<p>If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on GitHub. GitHub does not knowingly collect information from or direct<br>
			any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, <br>
			we will unfortunately have to close your account. We don't want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules. <br>
			Please see our Terms of Service for information about account termination. Other countries may have different minimum age limits, <br>
			and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country,<br>
			you may not use GitHub without obtaining your parents' or legal guardians' consent. </p>

			<p>We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is stored in your repositories or other free-form content inputs.<br>
			Information in your repositories belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service.<br>
			Any personal information within a user's repository is the responsibility of the repository owner. </p>

			<p><h3>Repository contents</p></h3>
			<p>GitHub employees do not access private repositories unless required to for security reasons, to assist the repository <br>
			owner with a support matter, or to maintain the integrity of the service. Our Terms of Service provides more details.</p>

			<p>If your repository is public, anyone (including us and unaffiliated third parties) may view its contents. <br>
			If you have included private or sensitive information in your public repository, such as email addresses or passwords, <br>
			that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. In addition, while we do not generally search for content in your repositories,<br>
			we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures, or for known active malware. </p>


			<p><h3>Changes to our Privacy Statement</p></h3>
			<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, GitHub may change our Privacy Statement from time to time. <br>
			We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website at least <br>
			30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending email to the primary email address<br>
			specified in your GitHub account. We will also update our Site Policy repository, which tracks all changes to this policy.<br>
			For changes to this Privacy Statement that do not affect your rights, we encourage visitors to check our Site Policy repository frequently. </p>
