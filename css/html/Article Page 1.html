				GOAT VS GOAT!

				On July 25th Jonathan Rodgers left his 15 year home of Boston to go and play for an <br>
				oppostition team, now 3 months later he returns facing his former team and most <br>
				importantly his other half. Legendary coach Bill McCarthy who it is rumored to <br>
				have forced Rodgers out has been linked to Rodgers once they both came into the <br>
				league will now face Rodgers for the first time. McCarthy has had a great start <br>
				without his former star, winning 5 and drawing 1. Rodgers who has been unable to <br>
				win a game so far with 3 draws and 3 losses. For this reason McCarthy and Boston <br>
				are favoured by 3 points. While many say that on paper Boston should be favoured <br>
				by much more, the boys in Vegas have more confidence in Rodgers becoming more relaxed <br>
				within his new team. Last week he linked up with star running back James Leford to <br>
				rush for a combined 180 yards. This might not be very helpful to Rdogers as Boston <br>
				has become almost masters at defending the run, keeping last years best running back <br>
				to only 25 yards in as many carries. Rodgers has done the impossible before making <br>
				an amazing comeback from 18 points down while injured in just 5 minutes. Back then <br>
				he had McCarthy’s defense forcing a fumble and an interception. According to former <br>
				Boston wide reciver Julian Adams, he has more belief in his quarterback then the coach. <br>
				“We won mostly inspite of coach [McCarthy] and almost all of that was on Rodgers’ <br>
				shoulders. Coach is a foul and he is even more of a foul if he believes that he will beat him.” <br>
				This is a massive strike at McCarthy who has had his credentials questioned in the past. <br>
				Many former coaches have stated that McCarthy is an offensive mastermind. Making the <br>
				modern 'ground and pound' rushing style, which has made many younger quarterback's <br>
				lives and early career's much easier. This has also put into question Rodgers' <br>
				own credentials and many see him to be a 'game manager', which his current record <br>
				does add to the argument.
